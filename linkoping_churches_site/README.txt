LinkÃ¶ping Churches - Bilingual Map Site
---------------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html         -> Main bilingual map page (Swedish/English)
- churches.js        -> Dataset (bilingual) with verified coordinates
- README.txt         -> This file

How to use:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Upload the files to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your web host).
   - For GitHub Pages: create a repository, push files, and enable Pages from the repository settings.
   - For Netlify: drag & drop the folder in the Netlify dashboard (or connect to a Git repo).
3. Optionally shorten the URL (bit.ly) and generate a QR linking to it for printing on cards.

Notes:
- All coordinates in churches.js are marked coords_verified: true.
- If you want additional filters (service times, languages), edit churches.js to add fields.

If you want, I can also deploy to GitHub Pages for you or generate a print-ready evangelism card with QR code.
